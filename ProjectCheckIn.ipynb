We arrived at this decision because the topic of air pollution seems too broad for us to conduct an analysis and we found it hard to figure out a research question that's comlex enough to multiple analyses. After 2 group meetings, we decided that our research will be around the topic of \"How does poverty influence the body mass indexes of US citizens?\". \n",

This is partly because we want to integrate so many issues surrounding this topic of poverty. Right now we want to investigate variables like \"whether below the poverty line, unemployment, price of produce vs. junk food, availability of junk food around, health care accessibility\" would affect BMI. We are still working on it and we found it hard to narrow the question while maintain a certain complexity of our analyses."
